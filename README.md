🂡 War Card Game (Python)

A simple terminal-based implementation of the classic War card game, inspired by Chapter 1 of Fluent Python using namedtuple, __getitem__, and sequence behavior to model a deck of cards.
The game plays round-by-round, showing each card drawn so the player can follow along.
